    <h3>Objective Statement</h3>
    <p>
        I'm keen to promote healthier lifestyles, in creating different technologies to innovate the way users see
        fitness.
        When I was young I enjoyed seeing how things worked, this lead to my interest in IT, as years went on I gained
        an
        interest in health and fitness. Motivated to change the way everyday people see fitness I wanted to further
        study IT and
        learn how I can make a difference. Throughout my degree I have been able to work in teams which further
        developed my
        leadership skills as well as my time management skills.

    <h3>Workplace Experience</h3>
    <h4>Website and Social Media Development</h4>
    <p>While studying at Swinburne myself and a team of 4 other students were tasked with creating an online
        presence for a not-for-profit organisation. Our group had to conduct multiple meeting with the client,
        design and propose multiple solutions to the problem as well as develop a final solution that the client was
        happy with. For our client we created a <a href="https://ferntreegullyvillagetraders.org">website</a> from
        scratch using wordpress to allow our client to easily update the content on the site, as well as a whole new
        brand image that corresponded to the new social media platforms; <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/ftgvillagetraders/">instagram</a> and <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/ftgvillagetraders/">facebook</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Recreation of Flash App using HTML and Bootstrap</h4>
    <p>During my University course I also elected to complete work experience, I was paired with the company
        MarlinBD who wanted to focus my attention on their side business Instinx (a coaching tool). During this
        project I was responsible for the complete redevelopment of a flash app from Adobe Flash (depreciated) into
        HTML and Bootstrap. This project had many challenges like firstly trying to find a way to run a flash app on
        a modern PC. While I did find a solution at first it was concerning as it was the only way the client could
        show me what the previous version of the app did function wise and what content would need to be reproduced.
        This project taught me the importance of client interactions and how to learn without an instructor by your
        side.
